I'm a programmer on a mission to deliver great software and also a FOSS enthusiast and a student of Haskell and FP.

An eager explorer of cultures with a keen eye for diversity matters, I've come to realize how much clean, safe && inclusive technology can contribute to the well-being of all around us, regardless of who they are or where they come from.

Do you have an inspiring proposition? Just give me a shout-out!
