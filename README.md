June 25th 2018, aka “The day I first said &#60;h1&#62;Hello World!&#60;/h1&#62; and decided Software Development would be my passionate way of making an impact in this tiny blue dot at the corner of the Universe”!

An eager explorer of cultures with a keen eye for diversity matters, I've come to realize how much clean, safe && inclusive technology can contribute to the well-being of all around us, regardless of who they are or where they come from.

Thus my goal: to expand inclusion through tech. One jazzy, beautifully clean line of code at a time!

Do you have an inspiring proposition? Just give me a shout-out!
